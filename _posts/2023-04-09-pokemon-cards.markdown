**My Collection**

I really like Pokemon. My favourite Pokemon Cards that i have are my Kleavor V, Mewtwo V promo, Both of my full art trainers, Whimiscott VStar and finally both of my Vmaxs. You can go to my Youtube channel and watch [This video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/iH4eyeHQKhc) if you want to see my whole collection.

**What I Want in the Future**

I am going to hopefully get the new pokemon pack Scarlet and Violet. On Saturday, i went to walmart and i saw they had a Crown Zenith ETB! But it was $80! That was too expensive. I hope to get better pokemon cards in the future.
